# FisheyeCorrection

This is code that I wrote as part of a project while being a sophomore at Brown university during computational vision class. In order to use gopro footage to recognize faces/label semantic scenes, we needed our footage to be unfisheyed. This is the matlab code that I wrote that unfisheyed the video footage.
